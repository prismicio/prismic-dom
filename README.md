## JavaScript library with static helpers to render HTML with Prismic API V2 BETA

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/prismic-dom.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/prismic-dom)
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/prismicio/prismic-dom.png)](https://travis-ci.org/prismicio/prismic-dom)

* The [source code](https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-dom) is on Github.
* The [Changelog](https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-dom/releases) is on Github's releases tab.

It's meant to work in pair with the prismic-javascript library, a new javascript kit for the prismic API v2 available here:
* [prismic-javascript](https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-javascript) is on Github.

### Installation

#### Prismic Api Endpoint
Your endpoint must contains "v2" at the end, otherwise it means that you're working on the API V1 so this library won't work for you.

```javascript
apiEndpoint: your-repo-name.prismic.io/api/v2
```

#### NPM

```sh
npm install prismic-dom --save
```

#### CDN

```
https://unpkg.com/prismic-dom
```

(You may need to adapt the version number)

#### Downloadable version

On our release page: [https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-dom/releases](https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-dom/releases).

The kit is universal, it can be used:

* Server-side with NodeJS
* Client-side as part of your build with Browserify, Webpack
* Client-side with a simple script tag

### Demo project

You can find an integration of prismic content with the new API V2 in the following project:
* [Node.js project](https://github.com/arnaudlewis/prismic-apiv2)

### Usage

With NodeJS, you can expose PrismicDOM directly in your locals to have it in your templates:
``` javascript
import PrismicDOM from 'prismic-dom';

res.locals.DOM = PrismicDOM;
```

Render a RichText:

 * As Html
```javascript
  DOM.RichText.asHtml(mydoc.data.myrichtext, linkResolver)
```

 * As Text
```javascript
  DOM.RichText.asText(mydoc.data.myrichtext)
```

Get a URL from a Link fragment of any kind

```javascript
//link resolver not required if sure that it's not a document link
DOM.Link.url(mydoc.data.mylink, ctx.linkResolver)
```

Convert a Date as string from the API to an ISO Date:

```javascript
DOM.Date(mydoc.data.mydate)
```

#### Install the kit locally

Source files are in the `src/` directory. You only need [Node.js and npm](http://www.joyent.com/blog/installing-node-and-npm/)
to work on the codebase.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Documentation

Please document any new feature or bugfix using the [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) syntax. You don't need to generate the documentation, we'll do that.

If you feel an existing area of code is lacking documentation, feel free to write it; but please do so on its own branch and pull-request.

If you find existing code that is not optimally documented and wish to make it better, we really appreciate it; but you should document it on its own branch and its own pull request.
